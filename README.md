## Hi👋 My name is Tomi
I'm a software developer focused on building scalable solutions. I believe the best way to **learn is by doing**, not by watching endless tutorials.  
I do/build to learn!


- ❤️ I'm really pragmatic and I love to build and craft products with an efficient user-first experience.
- 🔭 I’m constantly honing my problem-solving skills to build better, more effective solutions.
- 💼 Portfolio: Coming soon - in the meantime, feel free to explore my Github.
- 🤔 I look forward to connecting with more people who love building and solving real-world problems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting and challenging projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding/working, I’m either exploring something new, enjoying a good movie, or traveling.
